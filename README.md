## SVM

Support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learbing algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficientlz perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
